# SEE Injection Framework 2021
This repository contains two Single Event Effect (SEE) injection platforms. The first one is called **BFSP - "Bitflip Fault Injection Platform"** and it is targeting the executable file of a software application, simulating Single Event Upset (SEU) and Multi-Bit Upset (MBU) inside the main memory of an embedded processor. The second platform is called **GDBitflip** and it is targeting the processors registers, simulating SEU and MBU affecting them during the runtime.
